# Data Mesh

Data Mesh is a paradigm that provides a set of principles to change the architectural and organizational approaches to analytical data. Analytical data is a crucial asset to diagnose running businesses and augment them with ML models. 
To shift from a gut-driven business to a culture of data curiosity and valid experimentation.

There are a bunch of different personas that are included in the data work <ToDo - classify them by tech skills and needs>:
* **Analytical data users** such as data scientists and analysts
* **Data Providers** application teams or data engineers
* **Infrastructure engineers or owners** 
* **Data governance teams**
* **Data Leaders or managers**

## The Shifts

## The four principles of Data Mesh
### Principle of Domain Ownership
Decentralize the ownership of analytical data to business domains closest to the data - either the source or its main consumer.

* Allows scalability - avoiding bottleneck of centralized data teams
* Allows continuous change
* Enabling agility by avoiding dependencies across teams
* Increasing business truthfulness - people that fetch and work with the data are together - increases the domain knowledge of the team working with it
* Increases resiliency of analytics and ML
### Principle of Data as a product
With this principle in place it is possible to share data as a product with data users that may come out of the domain.

* Discoverable
* Addresable
* Understandable
* Trustworthy und truthful
* Accessible
* Interoperable
* Valuable on its own
* Secure
###Principle of the selve serve Data Platform
The main purpose of the Selve-serve Data Platform is to empower domains cross-functional teams to share data products

* it reduces the cost of decentralized data ownership
* reduces the complexity of managing end-to-end lifecycles of data products
* Mobilize a larger population of developers
* Enforces the automation of governance policies
### Principle of Federated Computational Governance
* Countering the undesirable consequences of domain-oriented decentralizations - enforces that data can be connected and is understandable
* Allows to build-in cross-cutting governance such as security, privacy, legal, compliance, etc
* Reducing the overhead of synchronization of governance teams with the data producers
