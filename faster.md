# Smarter Faster Better - Charles Duhig

## Transform a chore by making it to a deliberate decision that helps your autonomy
Our brain enjoys to make decision - it feels good to leave the crowded freeway even if you need than longer - there is something that you could do against it. It is possible to make an entire decision to become active. This can be trained and influenced. Story of a business man who lost the ability of motivation and his wife tarted to bombard him with decision, which resulted in loosing the apathy.
The Marines changed there training to improve the decision abilities of there recruits. 

## Group Norms
Psychological Safety is the main driver for high effective teams. This can be improved be equal speak time in meetings.
Massive study from Google which identified 5 important factors.
1. Psychological safety: Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.
2. Dependability: Everyone completes quality work on time.
3. Structure and clarity: Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.
4. Meaning: Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).
5. Impact: Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.


## Mental Models
Making a narrative our of normal days - eg imagine what your child will tell you in the evening or try imagine the next meeting and imagine how you will react. The story was a pilot of an A380 who managed to safe the airplane in a catastrophe by mental modeling the flight to a Cessna. By doing this he found a way to focus on decisions that needed to be made. The deliberate decision is important to drive the situation and find a way to focus on important and avoid tunneling. Without the mental model, the brain needs time to switch from a passive to an active state.

## Goal Setting
GE build up a model to set up goals inside their company and called it „Smart Goals“. The process is that every person has to write a letter to the supervisor and describe the goal in this letter. The goals has to be as specific as possible. Unfortunately one side effect of this was that people put more effort in describing achievable goals, which were trivial and basically meaningless - like I need to order x until y - and left out the ambition. This is where stretch goals come into play. They build up a process which is called __Workout__. This are regular meetings for all employees to propose ideas which are than challenged by upper management to see which is the maximum that is achievable without losing a sense of reality.
