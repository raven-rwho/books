## How to size a team

## Strategies, Visions and Goals
### Goals - They are importnt to decouple the "How" from "What"
A good goal should consist of 4 "numbers"
- Target - where you want to reach 
- Baseline - where are you in the moment
- Trend - describes the current velocity
- Timeframe - bounds for the change
An example for a good goal is: "In Q3 we decrease the time to render our frontpage from 600MS (P95) to 300 MS (P95). In Q2 render increased from 500MS to 600MS."
