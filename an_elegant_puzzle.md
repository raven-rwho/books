## How to size a team

## Strategies, Visions and Goals
### Goals - They are importnt to decouple the "How" from "What"
A good goal should consist of 4 "numbers"
- Target - where you want to reach 
- Baseline - where are you in the moment
- Trend - describes the current velocity
- Timeframe - bounds for the change
An example for a good goal is: "In Q3 we decrease the time to render our frontpage from 600MS (P95) to 300 MS (P95). In Q2 render increased from 500MS to 600MS."

## Migrations
Migrations are essential to every tech org. If a system needs to be scaled after a while, this is just a sign that the system was planned appropriately at its beginning.
Playbook for migrations:
1. De-Risk
   - Design Document start with the hardest team to evolve the design. Implement it also first in the hardest team to make sure you learn. Each team who is endorsing a migration with you they make a bet that you and your team will make that migration done.
2. Enable
   - Build tooling and documentation to achieve self service (incremental and reversible).
3. Finish
   - achieve 100% adoption - at the end this means normally that the migration team needs to do the nitty gritty clean up on the hardest cases itself

## Organizational Re-Org
1. Validate that is the right tool
2. project head count
3. target ratio management to contributer
4. Identify logical teams and groups of teams
5. staff the teams
6. commit to move forward
7. roll-out the change
