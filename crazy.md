Fomo vs JOMO
Fear of missing out vs. Joy of missing out

Depdenceies:
Real dependencies nearly never exist in Software Development -> there is normally no dependenciy between web and mobile, it just exists in the head of devs and prod people.

Commitment not Concesus:
Do not try to convince everyone this ends in Hippo decisions - use disagree and commit. It is perfectly fine if someone disagrees but commits. Decide, explain and go, every decision must be clearly communicated to every participant.
