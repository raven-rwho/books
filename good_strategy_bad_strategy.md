# Good Strategy / Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt

## Good Strategy
1. Having a coherent strategy - one that coordinates policies and actions.
2. The creation of new strengths through subtle shifts in viewpoint.


## Bad Strategy
1. **Fluff** - Fluff is a form of gibberish masquerading as strategic concepts or arguments. It uses Sunday words and apparently esoteric to create the illusion of high-level thinking
2. **Failure to face the challenge** - Bad strategy fails to recognize of deinen the challenge. When you cannot define the challenge, you cannot evaluate a strategy or improve it.
3. **Mistaking goals for strategy** - Many bad strategies are just statements of desire rather than plans to overcoming obstacles.
4. **Bad strategic objectives** - A strategic objective is set by a leader as a means to an end. Strategic objectives are “bad” when they fail to address critical issues or when they are impracticable.
