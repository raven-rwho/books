# Flow: Living at the Peak of Your Abilities - Mihály Csíkszentmihályi
Flow is described as the state where someone losses itself in the task and even time doesn't matter anymore.
Csíkszentmihályi defines found in several case studies that there are eight elements needed to reach a state of flow.  
1. Clarity of goals and immediate feedback:

the task must be explicitly clear and you need to get feedback as fast as possible. To translate this into the world of software development. The story must be cristal clear and properly discussed with your PO. You must be able to test your code immediatly - either via tests that were developed before - or if you are in the frontend by checking your visuals. But whatever you develop it must be a matter of seconds to test and execute your code to get feedback.

2. A high level of concentration on a limited field:

You need to concentrate on a problem and on one problem alone. If you try to hit a target with bow and arrow, you will be able to do it when you focus on your target and nothing else. Pretty much the same is true for development. If you get lost in formatting and fiddeling around in other parts of the profect - it will get very tricky to finish your task.

3. Balance between skills and challenge:

Your skillset and the task must be match with each other. You know how frustrating it is to learn a new tech/language - even the easiest things take ages. On the other hand if you are an experienced dev and you only get boring and repitive tasks - like linting or other stuff that should be automated! - you will get bored.

4. The feeling of control

I guess most of us know this awesome feeling when you have setted up your project in a way - with all the boilerplate that is needed to handle models, fetch data, etc - and then finally have all tools at hand that allow you to reach your goal by composing everything together. Another good example is protecting yourself with tests - so you never need to worry to you broke something else. By doing this you can reach a state of security and relaxation without any worry.

5. Effortlessness:

Developing runs smoothly and you always know which is the next step. From the outside it may look strenuous, yet in fact if the developer is in flow she does not experience any feel of strain. The activity is guided by an inner logic and for the dev it should feel that it has to go that way. 
You can support this by providing rules that goes true for every story, like first you need to branch and create a PR, then you need to cover you ass with tests. Make sure that you have a flawless and easy CI build process, to make it explicitly clear how the process works.

6. An altered perception of time:

Time feel condensed, two hours feel like ten minutes or expanded - ten seconds or stretched into minutes.

7. The melting together of action and consciousness

Developers do not feel separated from their actions - they are one with their performance. This unity can be expanded to whole team (team flow). I have experienced this in pair programming - which is extremly strainful in the beginning. But after a while it becomes natural to work together and your partner and you will work as a union which means less errors and faster development with more joy.

8. The autotelic quality of flow-experiences: IROI

From Greek autos – self and telos – goal. Not only achieving the goal of an activity is rewarding but the activity in itself is fulfilling. Flow is therefore “Immediate Return on Investment”.

Developing or building software must be rewarding in itself. You always should have the feeling of generating value - or at least not break someone elses code :-)

There are studies that prove that kids in the 6th grade are primed that work is tedious and having fun is meaningless! This means our society teaches us, that work has to be hard, cumbersome or boring and having fun is meaningless for reaching your goals. By changing your work in a way that you have fun with it, you normally also become more efficient. Csíkszentmihályi tells the story of a woman who has worked on a manual register. This is a boring and extremely repetitve task. By imagining that she is playing the piano on her register, she had more fun at work and she became by far the most efficient worker. Another nice example is a professor who imagines to play the piano while sitting in boring lectures. He is playing with his fingers on the table. by doing this he is able to enjoy his time while at work and is in control about his mood.

## Autotelic Personalities:
Csikszentmihalyi’s Definition of an Autotelic Personality
 "′Autotelic′ is a word composed of two Greek roots: auto (self), and telos (goal). An autotelic activity is one we do for its own sake because to experience it is the main goal. [ ] Applied to personality, autotelic denotes an individual who generally does things for their own sake, rather than in order to achieve some later external goal" (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997, p. 117).
"The mark of the autotelic personality is the ability to manage a rewarding bal- ance between the ′play′ of challenge finding and the ′work′ of skill building" (Csikszentmihalyi et al., 1993, p. 80).

Characteristics of a Person with Autotelic Personality: 
- __Persistent__: A person with Autotelic Personality remains on course in spite of difficulty or conflict.
- __Curious__: A person with Autotelic Personality has a limitless desire to learn and discover.
- __Low Self-centered__: A person with Autotelic Personality, just like being in the Flow State, the sense of self is being lost.
- __Open to Experience__: People with Autotelic Personality expand their possibilities, learn from others, adapt to new situations, and adopt new ideas.
- __Action-Orientation__: This time, the colloquial term, “Go with the Flow” does not apply. People with Autotelic Personality play with the edge of their abilities.
- __Positive__: A person with Autotelic Personality has a high hope for success and low fear of failure.
- __Internal Locus of Control__: Compared to External Locus of Control, which is the belief that results are commanded by powerful others, environmental influences, or chance, Individual who adopt in Internal Locus of Control believe that the outcomes and events are in their control.
- __Internal Drive__: People with Autotelic Personality have a high rate of performing acts for essential reasons. They are less influenced by money, prestige, and other extrinsic factors.
- __Loves Challenge__: People with Autotelic Personality have a higher likelihood of participating in hobbies and taking on challenges.
- __Willing to Learn__: Enhancing one’s skills is inevitable when flow is involved. A person with Autotelic Personality is willing to learn about its limits.
- A disposition to actively seek and create optimal challenges.

## How to obtain Autotelic Personality with Flow

1. __Setting Goals__ – To experience flow, you need to have clear goals to strive for. This includes massive lifelong goals to smaller goals, such as figuring out what to do this afternoon. An autotelic personality can make decisions with a minimum of extra effort allowing her/him to focus her/his energy on obtaining that goal.
2. __Becoming Immersed in the Activity__ – Whatever field you are in; Sports, Work, Business, etc., you need to become immersed in your task. A person with autotelic personality will give all of his/her attention directly to the task at hand. Being in control of your own attention is one of the most powerful skills a person can develop. A wandering or constantly distracted mind can cause your attention to spread and dilute.
3. __Learning to Enjoy Immediate Experience__ – Our bodies and minds have absurd capabilities of enjoyment. Gaining full control over your mind opens an individual to experience almost anything and derive joy. Every taste, smell, sound, thought, and observation can be the anchor of immediate enjoyment if we take the time, focus, and effort to experience it.
