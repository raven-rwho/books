# Flow: Living at the Peak of Your Abilities - Mihály Csíkszentmihályi
Flow is described as the state where someone losses itself in the task and even time doesn't matter anymore.
Csíkszentmihályi defines found in several case studies that there are eight elements needed to reach a state of flow.  
1. Clarity of goals and immediate feedback:

the task must be explicitly clear and you need to get feedback as fast as possible. To translate this into the world of software development. The story must be cristal clear and properly discussed with your PO. You must be able to test your code immediatly - either via tests that were developed before - or if you are in the frontend by checking your visuals. But whatever you develop it must be a matter of seconds to test and execute your code to get feedback.

2. A high level of concentration on a limited field:

You need to concentrate on a problem and on one problem alone. If you try to hit a target with bow and arrow, you will be able to do it when you focus on your target and nothing else. Pretty much the same is true for development. If you get lost in formatting and fiddeling around in other parts of the profect - it will get very tricky to finish your task.

3. Balance between skills and challenge:

Your skillset and the task must be match with each other. You know how frustrating it is to learn a new tech/language - even the easiest things take ages. On the other hand if you are an experienced dev and you only get boring and repitive tasks - like linting or other stuff that should be automated! - you will get bored.

4. The feeling of control

I guess most of us know this awesome feeling when you have setted up your project in a way - with all the boilerplate that is needed to handle models, fetch data, etc - and then finally have all tools at hand that allow you to reach your goal by composing everything together. Another good example is protecting yourself with tests - so you never need to worry to you broke something else. By doing this you can reach a state of security and relaxation without any worry.



5. Effortlessness
